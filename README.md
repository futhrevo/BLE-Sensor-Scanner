Overview: 
A BLE hardware is designed similar to a beacon. The hardware has an accelerometer, temperature sensor & light intensity meter. The device is generally sleeping/inactive. When the device is moved or tapped, it does the temperature and light intensity measurement and sends out beacon for some time and then goes to sleep again. An android app is required to show the sensor values and few other details.
